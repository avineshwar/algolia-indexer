  "bio": "I am a spider scientist, educator, and science communicator based in Pittsburgh, PA. I study how and why animals use color, shape, and movement to talk to each other! In particular, I am interested in how jumping spiders get their audience's attention when performing their spectacular courtship dances. My favorite part of science is sharing it with others through formal and informal teaching, science writing, social media, and outreach events.\n\nI was born in Colombia, and grew up in Forest Hills, NYC. In 2013, I earned a B.S. in Biology and Applied Physics at the University of Miami. I completed my PhD in the Richards-Zawacki Lab at the University of Pittsburgh in May 2020. In my free time, I enjoy video games, hiking, and wildlife photography. While I love all animals, there is a special spot in my heart for spiders and other arachnids, and I keep a small collection of arachnids that join me in my educational programs.",
